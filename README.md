#vrJASS
_Because you deserve a better yet familiar flavor_

_Even better flavor than before_

##What is vrJASS?
A new and just-for-fun/learning-intended-to project which aims 
to improve and rebuild from scratch the old and loved vJASS.

##How can I help you?
If you know Java or Antlr4 you can check the repository and send 
me pull requests (don't worry if you don't know too much about them, 
I'm new too!). If you don't know these languages, let me know your 
suggestions, I'm open to them :)

##What does vr mean?
Pick the one you like the most:

- Beer (default), because everyone loves beer
- Vexorian r$~%d-newbetterversionftw
- Vexorian (creator of vJASS, respect) Ruke

##How to compile it?
###Eclipse
- Right click to pom.xml
- Run as...
- Maven install


##How to use the compiled vrjass?
```bash
$ cd path/to/compiled/files
$ java -cp '*' com.ruke.vrjassc.vrjassc.util.vrjassc path/to/map.w3x or w3m
```

This WILL change the source code of the map and will transform any vrJASS code to raw JASS.
